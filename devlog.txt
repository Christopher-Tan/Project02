Christopher Tan (1/12 11:45): Set up basic files (client.h, client.c, server.h, server.c, and makefile) including "includes" and make.
Christopher Tan (1/13 11:45): Set up server side networking code (server_setup and server_accept)
Christopher Tan (1/13 19:22): Filled in client side connection code
Christopher Tan (1/15 18:32): Completed select server, no current game mechanics though
Christopher Tan (1/15 21:12): Tried to implement linked list and pairing system, as well as communication, encountering multiple errors at the moment.
Christopher Tan (1/15 23:00): Fixed errors, turns out the only errors were forgetting to set the linked list = remove_node() and forgetting a break statement in my recursion
Christopher Tan (1/18 11:45): Set up the client for move exchanges
Christopher Tan (1/21 11:45): Worked on importing SDL2 & improving circle algorithm
Christopher Tan (1/22 23:45): Installed SDL2 on personal computers, used Theo's code to insert the SDL2 component of the game into the client's interface (meaning changing the makefile, client files, game.h, and doing clean up on project), finished the victory checking function.
